## Toggle Switch Component

A toggle switch component is a simple yet useful UI element that allows users to switch between two states, typically "on" and "off". It can be used for a variety of purposes such as enabling/disabling features, toggling visibility, and more.

**Features**

- A switch that toggles between on and off states.
- Change the appearance based on the current state (e.g., different colors for on and off).
- Display the current state (e.g., "On" or "Off").

**Key Concepts**

- Toggling state with useState: Use React's useState hook to manage the state of the toggle switch.
- Conditional styling based on state: Apply different styles depending on whether the switch is on or off.
- Event handling for the toggle action: Handle the click event to change the state of the switch.

**Detailed Explanation**

- State Management: We'll use the useState hook to manage whether the switch is on or off.
- Styling: We'll use conditional styling to change the appearance of the switch based on its state.
- Event Handling: We'll handle the click event to toggle the state of the switch.
